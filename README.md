A BSc dissertation project

A series of Jupyter notebooks outlining the progress and process.

Initially tried to replicate a formula found in a research paper, this proved unsuccesful due to ambiguity and contacting the author didn't result in a reply.

Thereafter we explorer different supervised learning models and showed results via plots.

Finally these models were part of a simple PoC website built on the flask framework.

Note: the datasets used could not be uploaded due to size
